I worked as a **Graphic Designer** for the HackerEarth Banasthali Vidyapith chapter, creating clean, readable social creatives for announcements, reminders, and event promotion.

**What I did**
- Designed event posters + social assets for Instagram  
- Helped keep visuals consistent across posts and campaigns
