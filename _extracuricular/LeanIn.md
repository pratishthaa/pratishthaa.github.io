I started at Leanin as a **Graphic Designer**, creating event posters, story assets, and campaign creatives. I later became **Graphic Designer Lead**, where I helped set a consistent visual direction and supported others on the team. Eventually, I served as **Circle Head**, helping coordinate chapter initiatives and execution.

**What I did**
- Designed social media creatives for events, updates, and campaigns  
- Standardized design style to improve consistency across posts  
- Supported planning + coordination as Circle Head
