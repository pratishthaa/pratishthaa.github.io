As a **Workshop Coordinator** at Mayukh, I organized **20+ workshops** (technical + non-technical) reaching **~15,000 students**. I owned the logistics end-to-end—from registrations and promotions to coordinating with speakers/organizers and managing execution.

**What I did**
- Planned and executed 20+ workshops across multiple themes and formats  
- Managed logistics: registration, advertising, communications, timelines  
- Coordinated with organizers/speakers and led a **15-person** team
