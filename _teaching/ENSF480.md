I supported **ENSF 480 (Principles of Software Design)**, covering systematic approaches to designing quality software—abstraction, modularity, modeling, and designing for non-functional properties.

**My role**
- Hosted **lab hours** to support students with design exercises and implementation questions
- **Graded** labs/assignments with feedback focused on design quality and readability
- Helped students connect “design principles” to the reality of building maintainable software
