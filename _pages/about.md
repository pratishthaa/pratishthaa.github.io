I’m a multidisciplinary software developer from **Calgary, Alberta**. I moved here from India. I recently completed my **MSc in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary (fully funded)**, where I worked under the supervision of **Dr Diwakar Krishnamurthy**. I did my undergraduate degree in **Computer Science and Engineering** in India (**BTech, Banasthali Vidyapith**).

Over the past few years, I’ve focused on building **applied, end-to-end systems**—especially where data is messy and the output needs to be reliable. My core strengths are in **applied development (XR Devices, Apps)**, **data-driven modeling**, and **machine learning deployment**: turning models into usable tools through **REST APIs**, validating behavior with **Postman**, and designing workflows that are testable, measurable, and maintainable.

In graduate research with **[ETHEREAL Research Lab](https://www.etherealresearchlab.ca)**, I worked at the intersection of **HCI, XR accessibility technologies, and statistical modeling**—building interaction systems and the supporting pipelines to evaluate them honestly in real use, not just clean demos. I’m motivated by work that blends human impact with technical rigor: building things people can use, and backing decisions with evidence.

Selected Experience
======

### 2023 – 2025 · Research Assistant — University of Calgary (ETHEREAL Research Lab)
- Built XR interaction systems and the data workflow around them (session logging → cleaning → evaluation).
- Worked with time-series hand-tracking / interaction data and developed scoring + validation methods.
- Collaborated with researchers and stakeholders to translate real-world constraints into system decisions.

### 2022 · Mitacs Globalink Research Intern — Athabasca University
- Built features for a cross-platform application using structured datasets.
- Worked with geospatial content and user-facing flows; focused on clarity and reliability.

### 2021 · Research Intern — Utrecht University
- Created repeatable preprocessing + analysis pipelines and ran baseline model comparisons.
- Summarized results into clear, decision-ready findings.

Open Source

I’ve contributed to open-source both as a **mentor** and a **contributor**—reviewing pull requests, helping debug issues, and improving documentation so projects are easier to join.
 
- Mentorship: **GirlScript Summer of Code** (mentor) · **GirlScript Winter of Contributing** (supervisor)  
- Contributor programs: **PClub Summer of Code**, **DevIncept**
